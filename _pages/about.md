I am a Ph.D candidate under the supervision of Dr. Yanjie Su at Peking University (PKU). My primary interests focus on how children understand probability and how they acquire possibility concepts. To address the mentioned issue, I utilize behavioral experiments, computational models, and electroencephalogram (EEG) to explore the cognitive mechanisms of children's processing of probabilistic information. Besides, I am also interested in animal cognition, which could reveal the origins of human intelligence.

I obtained my bachelor's degree at Beijing Normal University (BNU), where I worked with Dr. Qingfen Hu. Then, I joined Dr. Yanjie Su's lab in 2020 and work for my doctoral degree till now. I plan to find a post-doctoral position after my graduation. For now, I am still working on my doctoral dessertation.
